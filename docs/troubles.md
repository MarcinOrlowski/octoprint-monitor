## Troubleshooting ##

### Widget stuck in "Connecting" state ###

In most cases this means that widget is not configred correctly. Most likely configuration is incorrect,
be it API access URL or API key. In either case, please press right mouse button over installed widget, then
select "Configure OctoPrint Monitor..." form context menu and make sure your config is right. Widget will
automatically continue once correct settings are applied.
